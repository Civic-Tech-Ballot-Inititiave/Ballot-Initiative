    "\n",
    "How would you get such an issue on the ballot? According to the the City Council of DC (https://code.dccouncil.gov/us/dc/council/code/sections/1-1001.16), after getting your initiative approved by the council, you would then need to collect signatures from the registered voters in the district. If you get enough *validated* signatures, then your issue gets on the ballot and people can vote on it. But How many validated signatures do you need?  Here is a direct quote from the website:\n",
    "\n",
    "> In order for any initiative measure or referendum measure to qualify for the ballot for consideration by the electors of the District, the proposer of the initiative measure or referendum measure shall secure the valid signatures of registered qualified electors upon the initiative or referendum measure equal in number to **5% of the registered qualified electors in the District; provided, that the total signatures submitted include 5% of the registered qualified electors in each of 5 or more of the 8 wards**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you would need to get 5% of the total population of registered voters and 5% per ward (for at least 5 wards) for registered voters. How could you ensure you meet this threshold? Mostly through ballpark estimates. You get a bunch of volunteers to go out into the city and collect signatures, and then at the end of the day you tally how many you collected. You keep a running tally per ward, and you check the results against a voter database, so that when you finally submit the list to the DC BOE you have a good sense of how many signatures are valid. "

    "That's the end of the onboarding notebook. If you worked through this, you now know the basic functions that run in the background of the application, and you have all the knowledge you need to start making contributions. Here is a list of tasks you can explore as project contributions following this onboarding. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Medium-Size Tasks:** Involving additions to existing code and slightly changing existing structure.\n",
    "    - **Address Validation:** As shown in the above example, we only consider try to find voter record matchings between names. Ideally, we want to check the close matches for the names and *then* ensure that the associated addresses match what is found in the voter records DB. This is a missing feature of the current code. \n",
    "    - **Fuzzy Match Scoring:** We chose a pretty quick fuzzmatch method (`ratio`), but there are literally dozens of other methods we could explore. It would be good to understand which is the best one to use and why. \n",
    "    - Other methods are described here: https://rapidfuzz.github.io/RapidFuzz/Usage/fuzz.html \n",
    "    - **Streamlit Application Cleanup:** Most of the code as it is depicted in this notebook also exists in the `app.py` file for the streamlit application, but it is not in its most readable and well-documented form. Cleaning up that code and ensuring that it is written efficiently is a desired task. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Large Tasks:** Involving extensive rewrites of existing code and creating new structure.\n",
    "    - **OCR Approach:** Currently our approach to performing OCR on the ballots is incredibly sketchy. We need to effectively lie to GPT in order to get it to process the ballots correctly. This isn't ideal so we would *like* to find alternative OCR approaches that perform as well as GPT. (This has difficult to do since GPT performs so well)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Alternative Data Access Schemes:** This one is mostly ideation and testing. Currently, running the application is tied to the existence of a voter records csv (i.e., `raw_feb_23_city_wide.csv`) that exists locally on the user's laptop. This probably isn't the best approach for storing the voter records, so we would want to explore others. Some possibilities\n",
    "        - Database Storage: We could store the voter records file in a database that is accessed when we run the program. The problem is that this file is proprietary (although it can be requested), and we would want to limit access. \n",
    "        - User Upload: We could just require the use to upload their own CSV with properly formatted columns. This would make the application more generally applicable (e.g., anyone with a collection of PDF ballots and a voter records file could use it)\n",
    "        - Something Else: There might be some other ideas not listed above.     \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extra Large Tasks:** Involves extensive code writing and completing changing existing application structure. \n",
    "    - **More Robust Frontend and Stack:** The application \"frontend\" is currently generated by `streamlit`. This is good for quick and dirty demonstrations, but we might want something more robust in the future. Here are some possibilities. \n",
    "        - Django App: Transfer the stack to the django framework (https://www.djangoproject.com/). We could then use HTML/CSS Django templates to build the frontend. \n",
    "            - We could also use the Django backend but with React JS frontend. \n",
