    "\n",
    "How would you get such an issue on the ballot? According to the the City Council of DC (https://code.dccouncil.gov/us/dc/council/code/sections/1-1001.16), after getting your initiative approved by the council, you would then need to collect signatures from the registered voters in the district. If you get enough *validated* signatures, then your issue gets on the ballot and people can vote on it. But How many validated signatures do you need?  Here is a direct quote from the website:\n",
    "\n",
    "> In order for any initiative measure or referendum measure to qualify for the ballot for consideration by the electors of the District, the proposer of the initiative measure or referendum measure shall secure the valid signatures of registered qualified electors upon the initiative or referendum measure equal in number to **5% of the registered qualified electors in the District; provided, that the total signatures submitted include 5% of the registered qualified electors in each of 5 or more of the 8 wards**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you would need to get 5% of the total population of registered voters and 5% per ward (for at least 5 wards) for registered voters. How could you ensure you meet this threshold? Mostly through ballpark estimates. You get a bunch of volunteers to go out into the city and collect signatures, and then at the end of the day you tally how many you collected. You keep a running tally per ward, and you check the results against a voter database, so that when you finally submit the list to the DC BOE you have a good sense of how many signatures are valid. "

      "7. **Database of Voting Records**: The validated data is compared to a database (or dataframe) of voting records to ensure accuracy.\n",
